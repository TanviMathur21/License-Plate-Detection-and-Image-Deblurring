# License-Plate-Detection-and-Image-Deblurring
The flow of the project:
	Taking a high-resolution image of a car as the input image
	Detecting the number plate in the image and creating a bounding box
	Extracting the license number from the number plate using pytesseract
	Saving the image of the number plate and making it an input image for the image deblurring
	Adding a noise/blur to the image
	Recovering the pixels or image details by using SRCNN

Thank You ! :)
